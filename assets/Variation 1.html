		<h1> Prologue </h1><hr />
		<p>   <i><b>  He who has seen everything, <br />I will make known (?) to 			the lands.
			I will teach (?) about him who experienced all things,
			<br />... alike,
			Anu granted him the totality of knowledge of all.
			</p>
		<p>	He saw the Secret, discovered the Hidden,
			<br />he brought information of (the time) before the Flood.
			</p>
		<p>	He went on a distant journey, <br />pushing himself to exhaustion,
			but then was brought to peace.
			</p>
		<p>	He carved on a stone stela all of his toils,<br />
			and built the wall of Uruk-Haven,
			the wall of the sacred Eanna Temple, the holy sanctuary.
			</p>
		<p>	Look at its wall which gleams like copper(?),<br />
			inspect its inner wall, the likes of which no one can equal!
			</p>
		<p>	Take hold of the threshold stone--it dates from ancient times! 				<br />
			Go close to the Eanna Temple, the residence of Ishtar,
			such as no later king or man ever equaled!
			</p>
		<p>	Go up on the wall of Uruk and walk around,<br />
			examine its foundation, inspect its brickwork thoroughly.<br />
			Is not (even the core of) the brick structure made of kiln-fired 			brick,<br />
			and did not the Seven Sages themselves lay out its plans?
			</p>
		<p>	One league city, <br />one league palm gardens,<br /> one league 			lowlands, the open area(?) of the Ishtar Temple,<br />
			three leagues and the open area(?) of Uruk it (the wall) 				encloses.<br />
			</p>
		<p>	Find the copper tablet box,<br />
			open the ... of its lock of bronze,<br />undo the fastening of its 			secret opening. 
			</p>
		<p>	Take and read out from the lapis lazuli tablet
			how Gilgamesh went through every hardship.
